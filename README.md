# status.lol bookmarklet
*A simple bookmarklet extension for status.lol.*

Post from anywhere in your browser using our handy bookmarklet! If you pull it up when you’re on a web page, it’ll include a link to that page in Markdown (but you can edit your status to be whatever you’d like). 

**To install it,**
1. Clone this repo to your machine
2. Open [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/) in your browser
3. Check the box for Developer mode in the top right
4. Press the __Load Unpacked__ button and select the folder with the code

Done! You can start using the extension now.

***Note:*** When you install the extension, a page will open asking you to enter your omg.lol address name. If you want to change it later, you can change it from the extension options.
